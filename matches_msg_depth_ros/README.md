# matches_msg_ros
* Message definitions to communicate matches between nodes.
* we have two matches messages that can be transmitted, one without outlier flags one with outlier flags
* tracklets are assorted from current to old, so matches_msg.data[0].data[0] is the most current keypoint of the first tracklet
* timestamps have the same length as the longest tracklet and are assorted from most recent to oldest therefore ```match[tracklet_size-i] of some tracklet -> timestamps[timestamps.size()-i]``` holds
* matches shall be stored as m.data[0]=u, m.data[1]=v, m.data[2]=depth
* The depth of a given feature is estimated by using the corresponding lidar pointcloud associated with the camera image at a synchronized timestamp. It describes the z value of the corresponding world point in reference to the local camera frame at the given time in meters. Given the depth, the feature uv-coordinates in the image frame and the camera model, the (estimated) original 3D position of the feature can be reconstructed in the camera frame. 
The depth value is > 0 if the depth estimation succeeded, else it holds a value of -1
## Usage

* Use the structure
* you can show them with the matches_msg_viewer_ros_tool

## History
* added scaling for matching
* added timestamps per msg that correspond to matches. match[tracklet_size-i] of some tracklet corresponds to timestamps[timestamps.size()-i]
* exposed tracklet ids from feature_tracking
